Title: "CancerStage"
Description: "Logical model representing the cancer stage at the time of first diagnosis. The stage may be clinical or pathological: the clinical stage is derived from imaging evidence, while the pathological stage, when available, is derived from surgical evidence. Derived from Cancer_Common_Logical_Model_20260408.xlsx (sheet CancerStage)."

* value ^comment = "It represents the stage value. Its datatype and cardinality depend on the specific structure of the staging classification being used. For example, in the case of the TNM classification, three string values are expected: one for T (Tumour), one for N (Nodes), and one for M (Metastasis)."
