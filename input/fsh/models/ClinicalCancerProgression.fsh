Description: "Logical model representing the longitudinal evolution of the cancer disease, documenting disease status and extent at a specific point in time. Derived from Cancer_Common_Logical_Model_20260408.xlsx  (sheet ClinicalCancerProgression)."
Characteristics: #can-be-target

* cancerConditionAtDiagnosisReference 1..1 Reference(CancerConditionAtDiagnosis) "CancerConditionReference"
* cancerConditionAtDiagnosisReference ^definition = "Reference to the original cancer condition at diagnosis to which this progression refers."
* diseaseStatus 1..1 CodeableConcept "DiseaseStatus"
* diseaseStatus ^definition = "Disease status at this time point (e.g. progression, stable disease, remission, recurrence)."

* tumourGradeSystem 0..1 CodeableConcept "TumourGradeSystem"
* tumourGradeSystem ^definition = "Classification system used to define tumour grade, describing how abnormal tumour cells and tissue appear under microscopic examination (e.g. Gleason for prostate cancer, FNCLCC for soft tissue sarcomas). The grading system provides an indication of the biological aggressiveness of the tumour."
